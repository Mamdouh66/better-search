# Better-search

Better-search is a project that aims to explore a different approach when searching for podcasts. Traditional search engines rely only on keyword-based search and this is not ideal for many scenarios, I have had a bad experince in almost every podcast app when searching. So, I tried to explore what would happen when implementing a hybrid-search (keyword + semantic) mechanism. I explain the approach and the results in more detail in this blog [post](https://www.mamdouh.dev/1)
